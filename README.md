# Sudoku
Simple Sudoku app I made in 2015. 
All puzzles are generated on the fly. 
This means that the difficulty may differ significantly between 2 successive puzzles with the same requested difficulty, though not enough to invalidate the choice!
Has a cute animation for completed puzzles, complete with pop culture references from the time in code comments.
